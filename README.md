"# Kotlin-Introduction" 
# Kotlin Learning Project

This repository contains my practice and learning projects while exploring Kotlin programming language. The goal is to understand the syntax, features, and capabilities of Kotlin for Android development and general programming.

## Features of Kotlin Practiced:
- **Basic Syntax**: Variables, data types, and control flow.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance, and interfaces.
- **Functional Programming**: Lambdas, higher-order functions, and collections.
- **Null Safety**: Handling null references to avoid NullPointerExceptions.
- **Coroutines**: Asynchronous programming with lightweight threads.
- **Extensions**: Adding functionality to existing classes.
- **Android Development**: Integrating Kotlin in Android Studio, activities, intents, and more.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/DrSkyRitik-15/Kotlin-Introductions>
   ```
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio.
3. Make sure Kotlin is set up in the IDE.
4. Build and run the project to explore the features.

## Key Highlights
- Practiced key Kotlin concepts for Android development.
- Experimented with Spinner, Intent Activity, and Action Bar.

## Next Steps
- Deep dive into advanced Kotlin features like DSLs and multiplatform projects.
- Build a complete Android app using Kotlin.
